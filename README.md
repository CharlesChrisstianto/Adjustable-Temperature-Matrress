## Introduction

Quality sleep is essential for good health and well-being, as outlined in Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being. However, the demands of work and stress often disrupt sleep, leading to disorders such as insomnia. Insomnia results in energy deficiency, high blood pressure, and can even affect skin appearance. Many individuals struggle to wake up in the morning as well. Abrupt and insufficient alarms often leave the body feeling uneasy and groggy upon waking, which can have adverse effects on heart health and blood pressure.

In response to these challenges, we have developed the Adjustable Temperature Mattress project. This collaborative effort among three individuals aims to address the issues surrounding sleep quality by providing users with a customizable comfort solution. By allowing users to control the temperature of their mattress, we hope to contribute to improved sleep experiences and overall well-being, aligning with SDG 3.
